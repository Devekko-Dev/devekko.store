## APIs vs Implementations

A long-standing, generally accepted norm in the computing field distinguishes between software interfaces and implementations: Programmers should have to write their own implementing code, but they should be free to reimplement other developers' program interfaces.

This platform also enabled experienced Java programmers to take advantage of their investment in learning the Java declarations to invoke common tasks when developing new programs. The Court regarded this as the very kind of creativity that copyright law was designed to promote.

The jury had, moreover, heard evidence that reimplementation of APIs was common and accepted in the software industry as long as developers reimplemented the interfaces in independently written code. Sun executives had believed the widespread use of Java would benefit it.
